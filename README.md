# Python-_DSA_Pro
This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science and programming interviews. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts.

Implemented data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
Algorithms for sorting (bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort), searching (linear search, binary search), graph traversal (DFS, BFS), dynamic programming, etc.
Clear explanations and comments in the code for better understanding.
Sample problems and exercises for practice.
Usage:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Anantvasu200/python-_dsa_Pro.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd python-dsa
Run the code: python stack_file.py and Queue.py
